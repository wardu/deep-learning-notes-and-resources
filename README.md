# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Notes

Welcome to my repository of notes, resources, and insights on **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.
This project serves as a personal knowledge base where I document my learning journey while I complete my Master's in CS with AI. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this as inspiration for your own learning path.

## About This Project

This repository is a living document of my studies and experiments in ML and DL. It includes:

- Summaries of core concepts (e.g., supervised learning, neural networks, etc.).
- Code snippets and examples from my practice.
- Resources, such as books, tutorials, papers, and tools.

The goal is to create an accessible hub for my notes.

## Getting Started

If you're new to ML/DL or just browsing, here’s how to navigate this repo:

- Check the [Topics Covered](#topics-covered) section for an overview of what’s included.
- Explore the `notes/` folder for detailed markdown files on specific topics.
- Look at the `code/` folder for practical examples (if applicable).
- See the [Resources](#resources) section for recommended learning materials.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with any code examples:

- Basic knowledge of Python.
- Familiarity with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and PyTorch.
- A local environment with Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE.

- **Tools**
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Google Colab
  - Kaggle (for datasets, competitions and free-use GPUs)

More resources will be added as I discover them!

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Browse Notes**: Open the `notes/` folder. I will produce my notes as `.ipynb` files containing code examples.
2. **Run Code**: Check the `code/` folder for scripts or notebooks (e.g., `.ipynb` files) to see implementations.
3. **Contribute**: If you have suggestions or corrections, see the [Contributing](#contributing) section.
4. **Fork It**: Feel free to fork this repo and adapt it for your own learning journey!

## Contributing

I’d love feedback or contributions! If you’d like to add a resource, fix a typo, or suggest a topic:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/add-notes`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m "Added notes on CNNs"`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/add-notes`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please keep contributions clear, concise, and relevant to ML/DL learning.
